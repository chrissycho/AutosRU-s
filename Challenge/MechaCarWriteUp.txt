## Results
1. Design a multiple linear regression to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variables (predictor) within the MechaCar mpg dataset.
- Both vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
- The slope of the linear model is not 0 because we have significant results for certain predictors that account for variability observed in the dependent variabe. 
- This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to its p-value being less than 0.05 (p = 5.35e-11) and r^2 value is 0.68. 
- About 68% of the variance found in the mpg (dependent variable) can be explained by the predictors. 

2. Perform Suspension Coil T-Test

- The variance of the suspension coils do not exceed 100 punds per inch. Thus, the current manufacturing data meets this design specification.
- Perform one-sample t-test to determine if the suspension coil's pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds-per-inch.

<Result>
- Based on the t-test result (p = 0.51 greater than the alpha-level of 0.05), we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the sample mean and the population mean. 

<Study Design>
- If I were to compare the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market, I would investigte city miles per gallon, fuel consumptions, or highway miles per gallon. 
- The statistical analysis will be three different two-sample t-tests between the MechaCar prototype vehicle and another comparable vehicle on the market on their city miles per gallon (DV 1), fuel consumptions (DV 2), and highway miles per gllon (DV 3) to see if there's any statistical difference between these two types of vehicles. 
- Particularly, if we hypothesize the the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle will outperform the other comparable vehicle, we can use one-tailed two-sample t-test. 
- The null hypothesis: there will be no statistical difference between the two groups. 
- Alternative hypotheses: the MechaCar prototype vehicle will perform greater than the other comparable vehicle on 1) city miles per gallon, 2) fuel consumptions, 3) highway miles per gallon. 
- To perform the statistical analysis, we need to collect data. Since we are not conducting multipe regressions, we can have basic information about the MechaCar prototype vehicles and the comparable vehicles such as the year they were made, the manufacturer, etc. However, most importantly, we need to know each car's city miles per gallon, fuel consumptions for each year or month, and highway miles per gallon. With these information, we can conduct three two-sample t-tests on three dependent variables.
