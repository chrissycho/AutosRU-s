## Results
1. Design a multiple linear regression to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variables (predictor) within the MechaCar mpg dataset.
- Both vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
- The slope of the linear model is not 0 because we have significant results for certain predictors that account for variability observed in the dependent variabe. 
- This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to its p-value being less than 0.05 (p = 5.35e-11) and r^2 value is 0.68. 
- About 68% of the variance found in the mpg (dependent variable) can be explained by the predictors. 

2. Perform Suspension Coil T-Test

- The variance of the suspension coils do not exceed 100 punds per inch. Thus, the current manufacturing data meets this design specification.
- Perform one-sample t-test to determine if the suspension coil's pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds-per-inch.

<Result>
- Based on the t-test result (p = 0.51 greater than the alpha-level of 0.05), we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the sample mean and the population mean.
