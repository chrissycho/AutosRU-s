## Project Overview
In this module, we've learned to supply statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. 

<a name="resc"></a>
## Resources
- Data Source: [AutosRU's MechaCars Prototypes](https://github.com/chrissycho/AutosRU-s/blob/master/Challenge/MechaCar_mpg.csv), [MechaCars suspension coil](https://github.com/chrissycho/AutosRU-s/blob/master/Challenge/Suspension_Coil.csv)
- Software: R studio 1.1.463

## Objectives
- Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
- Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
- Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
- Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
- Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
- Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
- Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
- Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we have to perform a series of statistical tests and create a technical report that provides interpretation of findings. 

<a name="chalsum"></a>
## Challenge Objective
- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
